The [Recipe Finder](https://jennynguyen.shinyapps.io/recipe_finder/) is an R Shiny application that searches through recipes available on [NhuyHoa's Recipes](https://nhuyhoa-recipes.netlify.app/post/) for selected ingredients. All recipe information is stored on cloud database, which both the website and the application pulls from.
